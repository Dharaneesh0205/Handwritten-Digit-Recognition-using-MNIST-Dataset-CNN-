### **Project Title: Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, achieving over 98% accuracy. The model incorporates convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, with dropout to prevent overfitting, and can be executed via the provided Jupyter Notebook.

#### **Project Overview:**
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately recognize and classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known benchmark in the machine learning community, consisting of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9) in grayscale format. The goal is to train a CNN model that can generalize well to unseen data and achieve high accuracy in digit classification.

#### **Objectives:**
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the MNIST dataset for training by normalizing the image data and reshaping it to fit the CNN input requirements.
2. **Model Development**: Construct a CNN architecture that effectively captures spatial features from the images using convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers.
3. **Model Training**: Train the CNN model on the training set, employing techniques like data augmentation and dropout to improve model robustness and prevent overfitting.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance on a separate test set, analyzing metrics like accuracy and loss.
5. **Visualization**: Provide visual insights into the model’s training process, including accuracy and loss curves, and evaluate the model's predictions against the actual labels.

#### **Technical Details:**

1. **Dataset**: 
   - The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits, each image being 28x28 pixels.
   - The dataset is available in popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.

2. **CNN Architecture**:
   - **Input Layer**: Reshaped to fit (28, 28, 1) for grayscale images.
   - **Convolutional Layers**: 
     - The first layer uses 32 filters with a kernel size of (3, 3) and ReLU activation.
     - The second layer uses 64 filters with the same kernel size and activation.
   - **Pooling Layers**: Max pooling layers after each convolutional layer to down-sample the feature maps.
   - **Flatten Layer**: Converts the 2D matrix to a 1D vector for the fully connected layers.
   - **Dense Layers**:
     - A hidden layer with 64 neurons and ReLU activation.
     - An output layer with 10 neurons (one for each digit) and softmax activation for classification.

3. **Training Process**:
   - The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, using sparse categorical crossentropy as the loss function since it’s a multi-class classification problem.
   - The model is trained for a set number of epochs (e.g., 10) with a specified batch size (e.g., 64) and validation split to monitor performance on unseen data during training.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Model accuracy and loss are evaluated on the test dataset after training.
   - Additional metrics, such as the confusion matrix, can be used to analyze the classification performance across different digits.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted against epochs to visualize the learning progress and check for overfitting.
   - Sample misclassified images can be displayed alongside their predicted labels to identify where the model struggles.

#### **Expected Outcomes**:
- The CNN model is expected to achieve high accuracy (typically above 98%) on the test dataset, demonstrating its ability to generalize well to new, unseen handwritten digits.
- Visualizations will provide insights into the training dynamics and the effectiveness of the CNN architecture.

#### **Potential Extensions**:
- Experimenting with deeper architectures, dropout layers, and different activation functions.
- Implementing data augmentation techniques to artificially increase the training dataset size and enhance model robustness.
- Exploring transfer learning using pre-trained models for improved performance on similar tasks.
